The Cognitive Sciences Club is a student organization created to bring people interested in the cognitive sciences together and provide them with resources to learn more about the field and meet similarly-minded individuals. Our mission is to foster opportunities for those interested in pursuing the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science and to offer a platform for members to engage, learn, and share ideas with other like-minded individuals and professionals from varying technical and non-technical fields, such as computer science, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, neuroscience and the like. To accomplish this, we aim to facilitate knowledge acquisition through workshops by members and guest lecturers, networking opportunities, mentorship, and research opportunities. If you would like to be a part of our community, join our Discord by clicking the Discord link at the bottom of the page.
